Helpful tips!
We used the arrow keys to move pacman, so please use the up, down, right and left arrow keys on your keyboard. 
To create a portal you simply have to press the spacebar. 
A laser will appear and move in the direction pacman is facing until it hits a wall and creates a portal. 
There are a few ways to delete a portal, one press the spacebar before the laser hits a wall, two press spacebar after it hits a wall,
or three go through the portal as pacman and it will automatically close itself.
